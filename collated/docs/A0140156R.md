### Logic component  
<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>

**API** : [`Logic.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/oneline/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `Parser` class to parse the user command.
2. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a task) and/or raise events.
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

The Sequence Diagram below shows how the `Logic` component handles the `execute("del 1")` API call.

#### Model State
**API** : [`Model.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/oneline/model/Model.java)

A model state consists of a `ReadOnlyTaskBook`, as well as the predicate of the current filtered task list. Every time a mutating command (as specified by the `canUndo()` API) is called, the state of the model is stored in a ModelState as a stack.

Model then exposes indirect access to these states through the `undo()` and `redo()` API.

### Foreword
All commands have a standard format so that you can easily remember them. A typical command will take the form:

> `<Command> <Fields>`

The following segments will list and explain the various commands. The structure of the commands will be explained in this form:

> `<Command> <Required fields> [<Optional fields>]`

Words within the angle brackets "<" and ">" are meant for you to fill according to what is required.  

> `add Meeting with boss`

**Angle brackets** "<" and ">" denote fields which should be replaced with your own input. Note that the angle brackets are not included in the actual command.  

Words not within angle brackets are keywords, and should be typed as they appear. These keywords are usually prefixed with a period ‘.’.  

**Square brackets** "[" and "]" denote optional fields. You can choose whether or not to include these fields when entering commands.
