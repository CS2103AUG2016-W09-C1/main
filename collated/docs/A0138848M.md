### Architecture

<img src="images/Architecture.png" width="600"><br>
The **_Architecture Diagram_** given above reflects the high-level design of the OneLine. OneLine' main components are Main, Commons, User Interface (UI), Model, Logic, Storage.  

`Main` has only one class called [`MainApp`](../src/main/java/seedu/oneline/MainApp.java). It is responsible for initialising components in the correct sequence, and connecting components with each other when OneLine starts. Main also helps to shut down components and invokes clean-up methods when OneLine is exited.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) contains utility classes, customised exceptions, and other classes which may be used by multiple other components. Two classes play significant roles
* `EventsCentre` : This class (written using [Google's Event Bus library](https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained)) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` is used by classes to write log messages to OneLine’s log file.

[**`UI`**](#ui-component) manages the user’s interactions with OneLine. It listens to the user’s input entered via the command box. The UI will pass the information received from the users’ input to Logic, where it will then be handled and executed.

[**`Logic`**](#logic-component) is the control center of OneLine. When Logic receives new information from UI, it will pass the information to the Parser class to be processed, then executes the command that is returned. Logic also interacts with Storage to obtain tasks and categories from storage files as required.

[**`Model`**](#model-component) contains the Tag and Task classes, and stores OneLine‘s data in memory. Model watches for changes to OneLine’s data and handles these changes by raising appropriate events through EventsCenter.

[**`Storage`**](#storage-component) handles reading data from, and writing data to, the hard disk in the XML format.

The UI, Logic, Model and Storage components define their  _API_ in an `interface` with the same name. All functionalities are exposed through a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the Logic component defines its API in the Logic.java interface and exposes its functionality using the LogicManager.java class. The UML diagram below illustrates this architecture.  
<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>

The following _Sequence Diagram_ shows how the components interact to respond to a user’s `del 1` command.  
<img src="images/SDforDeleteTask.png" width="800">

> Note how the `Model` simply raises a `TaskBookChangedEvent` when OneLine's data is  changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to the event, which eventually results in updates being saved to the hard disk and the tag list being updated to reflect any possible changes.  
<img src="images/SDforDeleteTaskEventHandling.png" width="800">

> Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The following more details of each component.

### Model component  
<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>

**API** : [`Model.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/oneline/model/Model.java)

The `Model`
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences for OneLine's GUI.
* stores the TaskBook data.
* exposes a `UnmodifiableObservableList<ReadOnlyTask>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

#### Task
<img src="images/TaskUML.png" width="800"><br>

**API** : [`Task.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/oneline/model/Task/Task.java)

A `Task` must have a name and an `isCompleted` flag, but may not have a `deadline`, `startTime`, `endTime` or `tag`. To represent a `Task` without a `deadline`, `startTime`, `endTime` or `tag`, we call the relevant class’ `getDefault()` method. Note that all fields in `Task` are compulsory and cannot be null.

A `Task` is defined as one of the following:
* floating task: a `task` whose `deadline`, `startTime` and `endTime` are set to their default values.
* deadline task: a `task` whose `deadline` is valid, and whose `startTime` and `endTime` are set to their default values
* event task: a `task` whose `startTime` and `endTime` are valid, and whose `deadline` is set to its default value
